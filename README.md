# T20 Worldcup Analysis


## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive data analysis of the T20 World Cup 2022 using Python.  
It explores team and player performances, stadium conditions, and toss decisions through data-driven insights. The project uses libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. 
Key analyses include identifying top run-scorers and wicket-takers, exploring win ratios based on toss outcomes, and examining venue-specific performance. 
The project offers actionable insights for understanding trends and strategies in the T20 World Cup.


### Technical Aspects Covered 

- 1 : Data Collection & Loading

  Data sourced from CSV files containing match details, team performances, player statistics, and venue information.

  Pandas library is used for loading and organizing the data.
- 2 :  Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

  Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data for analysis.

  Grouping data for deeper insights like player-wise, team-wise, and venue-wise performance.
- 3 : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  Top Scorers & Wicket-takers: Filtering player data to analyze runs, boundaries, and bowling stats.

  Team Wins by Batting/Chasing: Insights into whether teams won more while batting first or chasing.

  Toss Decisions: Visualization of decisions (batting vs. fielding) and their impact on match results.

  Venue Analysis: Identifying stadiums favorable for batting or bowling using performance data.
- 4 : Data Visualization

  Matplotlib and Plotly are used to create:
  
  Bar charts showing the highest run scorers and leading wicket-takers.
  
  Pie charts demonstrating win/loss ratios based on toss decisions.
  
  Heatmaps for venue-specific performances.

### Key Takeways 
  
In our dataset, Some parameters were assigned value 0, representing those parameters are not applicable for some customers.

All these values have been ignored while calculating average rating for each of the parameters mentioned above.
